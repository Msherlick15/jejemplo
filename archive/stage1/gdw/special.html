<h1>Special Characters</h1>

<p>
&lt; &lt; &gt; &gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &amp;
&amp; &amp; &amp; &copy; &Cconint; &phone; &#9786;
</p>

<p>
Since &lt;, &gt;, and &amp; have special meaning in HTML, you can't use these 
characters to represent themselves. Instead, you need to use the so called
<q>special characters</q> to represent them. For example, to have a less than 
sign appear in your document, you need to use &lt; to represent it.
