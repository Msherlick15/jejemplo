<h1>Pretty Woman Song</h1>
<p>
Pretty woman, walkin' down the street<br>
Pretty woman the kind I like to meet<br>
Pretty woman I don't believe you, you're not the truth<br>
No one could look as good as you, mercy<br>
Pretty woman won't you pardon me<br>
Pretty woman I couldn't help but see<br>
Pretty woman that you look lovely as can be<br>
Are you lonely just like me<br>
Pretty woman stop awhile<br>
Pretty woman talk awhile<br>
Pretty woman give your smile to me<br>
Pretty woman yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
Pretty woman look my way<br>
Pretty woman say you'll stay with me<br>
'Cause I need you, I'll treat you right<br>
Come with me baby, be mine tonight<br>
Pretty woman don't walk on by<br>
Pretty woman don't make me cry<br>
Pretty woman don't walk away, hey, OK<br>
If that's the way it must be, OK<br>
I guess I'll go on home, it's late<br>
There'll be tomorrow night, but wait<br>
What do I see?<br>
Is she walkin' back to me?
Yeah, she's walkin' back to me
Oh, oh, pretty woman.
