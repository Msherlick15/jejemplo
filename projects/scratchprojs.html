<h1>Introduction to Programming with Scratch 3 Projects</h1>

<main>
<p>The following six Scratch 3 projects are the exercises in the
<a href="https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/codeclub/scratch-module-1">
Scratch: Module 1</a> from the
<a href="https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en">Raspberry Pi</a> projects
website.</p>

  <dt><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/284871630">Rock Band</a></dt>
  <dd>
  This project introduces the Scratch 3 environment, including the all
  important stage and sprite objects, and shows how to change costumes and
  play sounds in reponse to mouse-click-on-sprite events.
  </dd>
  <dt><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects//285313777">Paint Box</a></dt>
  <dd>
  <p>This project creates a paint program. It introduces the Pen extenstion,
  which is used to program a pencil sprite to draw.  Message passing is used to
  set pen color from color sprites. The pen had been a standard feature of
  Scratch 2, but now it has been moved into and extension.
  </p><p>
  Extension appear to be a great way to <i>extend</i> the funtionality of
  Scratch without making the basic interface overwhelmingly complex. In
  addition to the Pen, extensions for Music, Video Sensing, Text to Speech,
  Translate, and several that connect to real world sensors are available.</p>
